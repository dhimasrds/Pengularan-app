# iOS Build Cache Fix Summary

## Problem
The project encountered a Kotlin/Native cache corruption error:
```
Failed to build cache for org.jetbrains.androidx.navigation/navigation-common-iossimulatorarm64/2.7.0-alpha06
```

This was caused by:
1. Corrupted Kotlin/Native compiler cache
2. androidx.navigation being pulled as a transitive dependency (from androidx.lifecycle libraries)
3. The alpha version (2.7.0-alpha06) having known issues with Kotlin/Native compilation

## Solution Applied

### 1. Disabled Kotlin/Native Caching
Added to `gradle.properties`:
```properties
kotlin.native.cacheKind=none
```

**Why:** This works around cache corruption issues by disabling the caching mechanism. While this may slightly increase build times, it ensures reliability.

### 2. Cleaned All Caches
Removed:
- `~/.gradle/caches/modules-2/files-2.1/org.jetbrains.androidx.navigation/`
- `~/.konan/cache`
- `~/.konan/dependencies`

### 3. Verified Build
Successfully built the iOS framework:
```bash
./gradlew :composeApp:linkDebugFrameworkIosSimulatorArm64
```

## Build Status
✅ **BUILD SUCCESSFUL** - The iOS framework now compiles without cache errors.

## Running the iOS App

### Option 1: Via Xcode
1. Open `iosApp/iosApp.xcodeproj` in Xcode
2. Select your target device/simulator
3. Click Run (⌘R)

The Xcode build will automatically trigger the Gradle build with the correct environment variables.

### Option 2: Via Android Studio with KMM Plugin
1. Open the project in Android Studio
2. Select the iOS run configuration
3. Click Run

## Notes

### Voyager-Koin Warnings
You may see informational warnings about missing declarations in voyager-koin:
```
i: <voyager:voyager-koin> Can not read value from variable 'tmp0_safe_receiver'
```

These are informational only and don't prevent the app from running. They're related to compatibility between Koin Compose and Voyager.

### Performance Considerations
- **Caching disabled:** First builds may take longer
- **Alternative solution:** Once KMP dependencies stabilize, you can re-enable caching by removing the `kotlin.native.cacheKind=none` line

### Future Improvements
Consider these when dependencies mature:
1. Re-enable caching after verifying stability
2. Update androidx.lifecycle to versions with better KMP support
3. Monitor Voyager updates for Koin Compose compatibility improvements

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter similar cache issues in the future:

1. **Clean all caches:**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew clean
   rm -rf ~/.gradle/caches/modules-2
   rm -rf ~/.konan/cache
   rm -rf ~/.konan/dependencies
   ```

2. **Invalidate IDE caches:**
   - In Android Studio: File → Invalidate Caches → Invalidate and Restart

3. **Check dependency versions:**
   - Use stable versions instead of alpha/beta when possible
   - Monitor release notes for known KMP issues
